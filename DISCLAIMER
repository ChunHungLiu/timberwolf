The TimberWolf system is still evolving.  Several known problems
are known to exist.  They will be remedied as soon as possible
but in the meantime the code is distributed to enable
interface building.

Known problems include:

1) The ordering of the pseudo pins in mc_route is suboptimal.  Currently,
this algorithm is being modified.

2) Macro obstacles do not keep out routing when only 1 layer is specified. 
3) Soft pins may overlap at output.
