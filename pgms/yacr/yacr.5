.SH Yacr Input File Formats
.PP
Yacr can use either of two formats for input.
The information that is supplied by both formats
consists of:
the number of nets to be routed;
the number of columns in the channel;
a list of pins that connect to the top edge of the channel;
a list of pins that connect to the bottom edge of the channel;
the number of pins that connect to the left edge of the channel;
the list of pins on the left edge;
the number of pins that connect to the right edge of the channel; and
the list of pins on the right edge.
Two lists of "offsets" may also be specified.
The list of top offsets gives the relative distance towards the center
of the channel of each top pin.
The list of bottom offsets gives the relative distance towards the center
of the channel of each bottom pin.

First is a description of the default format,
then the format called for by the "-H" command line argument to Yacr.
.PP
The number of nets in the channel is specified with the following line:
.br
	nnet= #
.br
The number must be separated from the equals sign by at least one white
space character, a space, a tab, or a newline.
No other spaces are allowed.
.PP
The number of columns in the channel is specified with the following line:
.br
	ncol= #
.br
As with the number of nets, the only space allowed is between the equals
sign and the number.
The space is also required.
.PP
The list of pins on the top edge of the channel is begun with the keyword
"top_\|list".
The keyword is followed by a white space separated list of numbers,
representing nets.
The list must contain "ncol" integers.
The numbers need not be consecutive.
"0" is a special number that means "this location has no net connected to it."
.PP
The list of pins on the bottom edge of the channel is begun with the
keyword "bottom_\|list".
The restriction for the top list also apply to the bottom list.
.PP
The list of nets connecting to the left edge of the channel is begun
with the keyword "left_\|list".
The keyword is followed by a number telling how many nets there are
in the left list.
This is followed by the list of nets.
If there are no nets connecting to the left edge, this category may be
omitted.
By default, the order in which the nets are listed is not meaningful.
If a specific order is desired, "left_\|list" should be preceeded by the
keyword "relative".
The order in which the nets are listed is then the order (from top to bottom)
in which
they will appear in the final route.
If the word "fixed" instead of "relative", then an exact placement of
the edge nets is specified.
In this case, the edge list can contain zeroes like the top and bottom
lists.
The number of entries in a fixed edge list must be at least equal
to the inital width of the channel, which is the same as the maximum channel
density.
If the list is longer, the inital width of the channel will be increased
to the length of the list.
.PP
The list of nets connecting to the right edge of the channel is begun
with the keyword "right_\|list".
This category is exactly like the left list category.
An important restriction to note is that relative or fixed
order can be specified for only the left list
.U or
the right list.
If it is specified for both,
it will only be meaningful for the one that appears second in the
input file.
.PP
The optional list of offsets for the top pins of the channel is
begun with the keyword "top_\|offset".
It is followed by the list of offsets, 
which must contain "ncol" integers.
Each entry gives the relative distance towards the center of
the channel of the corresponding pin location or channel boundary,
in grid units.
The offsets normally range from zero upwards (with nonzero
values representing an indentation into the side of the channel),
but the values are internally scaled, so only the relative values
matter.
If all the values are identical,
the top border of the channel is straight, and the results obtained
will be the same as if no offsets were specified.
.PP
The list of offsets for the bottom pins is begun
with the keyword "bottom_\|offsets", and
is similar to the list of top offsets.
Note that a positive value still means that the corresponding
pin or channel border is moved closer to
the center of the channel.
One or both of the offset lists may be omitted.
.PP
The "-H" format is identical to the default format except that all
keywords are omitted (except "relative" and "fixed") and
all categories must be
included in the following order:
.br
	number of nets
.br
	number of columns
.br
	top list
.br
	bottom list
.br
	left list
.br
	right list
.br
	top offsets (optional)
.br
	bottom offsets (optional)
.PP
The left list and the right list must be included, if there are no
nets connecting to the edge of the channel, the list will be
a single "0".
The file will contain nothing but integers separated by white space,
unless the keyword relative is included for the left or right list.
The top and bottom offsets may be omitted if the sides of the channel
have no indentations.
.SH Yacr Output File Formats
.PP
Just as there are two input formats, there are two output formats.
One corresponds to the default input format and the other is used
with the "-H" flag or "-O" flag.
The default format is described first, then the differences between
it and the -H format follows.
.PP
The file begins with the following information:
input file; number of nets; number of columns; number of nets in the left
list; number of nets in the right list;
a list of edges removed from the vertical constraint graph to make it acyclic
(if any);
a list of columns with maximum density;
a list of columns that appear to be the best choices for starting column;
and the actual starting column.
.PP
The next section of the output contains a block for each "major attempt"
Yacr makes at routing the channel.
Each block has the number of rows used for the attempt, 
followed by a list of vertical constraint violations (VCVs) that
occurred, followed by a list of how each VCV column was routed
(if it was).
If a row was added to complete the route without starting over,
that is included at the end of the last block.
.PP
The next and most important section gives the routing of the channel.
The horizontal (metal) layer is given first, followed by the
vertical (poly) layer.
Each layer is described by a matrix of integers.
Each row in the matrix represents a column in the channel
(this keeps the lines shorter so a printout is easier to read).
There are rows to represent the left and right edges of the channel;
the extra rows are used to indicate nets that connect to the edges.
Each integer in the matrices represents the net that occupies a given space
in the grid.
"0" means the space is empty.
If offsets were specified,
spaces that correspond to indentations in the channel
(where no material can be placed) are represented by "X".
Vias are not explicitly given, but implied at each location that
the metal layer has the same net as the poly layer.
.PP
Finally, there is a summary that tells the number of vias used in the route,
the total net length of all the nets, the longest net, and how much
metal and poly were used to route the longest net.
.PP
The "-H" output format contains a minimum amount of information.
It contains no keywords, just integers.
The first two lines have the number of rows and columns, respectively,
in the channel.
The next row is the top row of the metal layer of the channel, listed
from left to right.
The entire metal layer is given followed by the poly layer.
There are no extra columns representing the edges of the channel.
The last line of the file has three integers, the first is the
number of the net with the longest route, the amount of metal used
to route it, and the amount of poly used to route it.
Spaces inside indentations are now represented by a "0".
