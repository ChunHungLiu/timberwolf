.SH NAME
TimberWolfDR\- A Detailed Router Based on Routing Modifications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B TimberWolfDR
[options] [file1 [file2]\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I TimberWolfDR
.pp
is a 2.5 layer symbolic detailed router for any rectagonal routing area.
The pins to be connected can be on the boundaries or inside the
rectagon, or exist on on objects inside the boundary known as macros.
Floating pins can be on either leftmost or rightmost
edge of the routing area.
.PP
File1 is the input, file2 is the output.
If file2 is omitted, the output goes to standard output.
If no files are specified, input is read from standard input,
and output goes to standard output.
.KS
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
The command line options described below can be specified in any
order, but must come before the input and output file names.
.TP 8
.B -r
Perform river routing.  TimberWolfDR is constrained to stay on the
given pin layer (layer 1 and 2 only).  Routing will fail if a 
layer change is necessary.
.TP 8
.B -s
Do not generate output of the routing; only print statistics
such as total wire-length, number of vias, etc.
.TP 8
.B -xgrid [integer]
.RS 
Perform following transform on input data point (x,y):  
x' = (x - xshift)/ xgrid
.RS
where 
.RS
xshift = minimum x over all (x,y).
.RS
.RE
xgrid = integer specified above.
.RE
.RE
This feature helps minimize the amount of memory need for gridded
channels.  If the pin is not on an exact multiple of the grid,
TimberWolfDR will dogleg into the pin.  TimberWolfDR will perform
the inverse operation at output; hence, the pin will be output
at the user specified point (x,y).
.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP 8
.B -ygrid [integer]
.RS 
Perform following transform on input data point (x,y):  
y' = (y - yshift)/ xgrid
.RS
where 
.RS
yshift = minimum y over all (x,y).
.RS
.RE
ygrid = integer specified above.

.TP 8
.B -e
Give the estimate of incremental channel width to complete the routing.
.TP 8
.B -d
Turn on verbose debugging output.  Not to be used normally.  Generates
large amounts of data.
.KE

The formats of input and output files are as follows:
.PP
The input file contains a number of key words and data in integers.
The key words are
.TP 8
.B 1)
number_of_nets :  Number of nets to be routed.
.TP 8
.B 2)
rectagoncorners : Number of corner points of the
rectagonal routing area, followed by coordinates
of the corners.
The coordinates of rectagon corners are listed
in counterclockwise sequence.  TimberWolfDR regards
the boundary of the routing area as a directed curve.
.TP 8
.B 3)
number_of_pins : Total number of pins to be connected,
followed by a list of pins.
Each pin is described by net-number,
x and y coordinates and layer-number.
.TP 8
.B 4)
left_list : number of nets going out through left edge
of the routing area, if any, followed by the list of
such nets.
.TP 8
.B 5)
right_list : number of nets going out through right edge
of the routing area, if any, followed by the list of
such nets.
.TP 8
.B 6)
obstacles : number of horizontal or vertical lines
of obstacles, if any, followed by a list of obstacles.
Each obstacle is a line segment with beginning
and ending point coordinates, and its layer-number.
.TP 8
.B 8)
macro : followed by a list of edges of obstructions.  Macros
are similar to obstacles except pins are allow to occur on macros.
Each macro is a line segment with beginning and ending point, 
followed by its layer1 flag and layer 2 flag.  If the edge is a 
barrier to layer1 then layer1 flag is 1 otherwise it is 0.  If the
edge is a barrier to routing on layer 2 then layer2 flag is
1; otherwise it is 0. Macros are used to implement keepout
regions for cells.
.TP 8
.B 9)
sensitive_nets : number of critical nets, if any, followed
by a list of critical nets.
These nets are routed before other nets with priority.
.PP
The origin of the coordinate system
of the routing area can be chosen arbitrarily.
For the current version of TimberWolfDR the layer numbers are 1, 2, 
and 3.
Layer 1 is mainly used for vertical connections and layer 2
is mainly used for horizontal connections.
Layer 3 is the half layer which runs in the vertical direction.  Layer
3 will only be used to make connections from a pin on the boundary
to a track in the routing region.
.PP
The output file  begins with a key word 'channelwiring'.
Then the number of vias used in the routing is given, followed
by the list of the vias with their net-number, x and y coordinates,
and two layer numbers they are interconnecting.
After that, the key word 'wires' is followed by the number of wire
segments and a list of wires.
Each wire is described by a net-number, two pairs
of coordinates for the endpoints and a layer 
number.
